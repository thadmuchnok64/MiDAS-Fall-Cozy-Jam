# MiDAS-Fall-Cozy-Jam
This was the first game jam participated by students of UF's MiDAS (Masters in Digital Arts and Sciences) students. The theme of the game jam was to make a game with a cozy fall atmosphere. In the game, the player is tasked with owning an antique shop, and must give the patrons items that they need. It turns out that the patrons, and the shop are not quite as they seem.
